# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive, layered map that easily depicts earthquake activity using sized and colored markers. The map can be toggled to display only earthquakes, only major earthquakes, only tectonic plate lines, or any combination of these. The map uses three views, including street, satellite or dark, and contains a legend to easily read the markers.
